    <p>
      Pulled pork sandwiches are a staple bbq item in many regions of America.
      The meat is succulant and tender and pairs excellently with cole slaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      One draw back with pulled pork is the cooking time and equipment needed
      for proper BBQ. This recipe aims to be a suitable alternative to the long
      low 'n' slow style BBQ pulled pork. This is made possible by the Insta
      Pot!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups caffeinated pepper-type soda (such as Dr Pepper®)</li>
      <li>2 cups barbeque sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray's®), divided</li>
      <li>1 pound pork tenderloin</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
      <li>2 cups prepared coleslaw (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Combine soda and 1/2 cup barbeque sauce in a multi-functional pressure
        cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Add pork tenderloin. Close and lock the
        lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set
        timer for 50 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
      </li>

      <li>
        Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
        manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove pork loin and drain liquid from the pot. Shred pork using 2
        forks. Return to the pot and mix in remaining 1 1/2 cups barbeque sauce.
      </li>

      <li>Serve on hamburger buns and top with coleslaw</li>
    </ul>
