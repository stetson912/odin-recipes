    <p>
      This is one of my favorite recipes. It is versatile in the sense that it
      is delicious as is but also goes well paired with your favorite pasta and
      sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe is great for a quick weeknight meal made from store bought
      ingredients or you can class it up by making your own pasta sauce and
      serving it all on top of spaghetti!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
      <li>1 yellow bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
      <li>1 small fresh okra pods, halved lengthwise</li>
      <li>1 small red onion, sliced into petals</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>5 (4 ounce) links hot Italian sausage links</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine bell peppers and onions in a large bowl. Add olive oil, Italian
        seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine. Using a toothpick, poke 4
        holes into each sausage to prevent them from exploding on the grill.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place vegetables in a grill basket and cook for 2 minutes. Add sausage
        directly to the grate and grill for 4 minutes. Flip sausage over, stir
        vegetables, and grill for 4 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
